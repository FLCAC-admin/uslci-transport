## General Information

description: >
    Electricity generation mixes by country, as sourced from Ember Climate, are
    linked to U.S. based generators and supply chains. These data represent a
    generation mix and do not account for transmission loss to end users.

# valid_until: 2023 # Assigned in code
# valid_from: 2023 # Assigned in code

time_description: >
    This process reflects the generation mix of the region over the course of
    the entire year. It reflects the most recently available full year.

geography_description: >
    This process represents the generation mix of the entire region.

technology_description: >
    This is the tech description.

## DQI methods


## LCI method

inventory_method_description: >
    Not applicable; this process contains only technosphere flows.

modeling_constants_description: >
    Approaches to compile and estimate generation mixes for specific countries
    by Ember Climate are described in the linked methodology document.
    Generation technologies were mapped to those available in the U.S.
    Electricity Baseline.

## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    This process contains no elementary flows. Generation mix of all technologies
    sums to 100%.

data_selection_description: >
    Data were retrieved for all available countries for the most recent data year.

data_treatment_description: >
    Generation by fuel subcateogry were normalized to total generation for each
    country to generate resource shares.

sampling_description: >
    No uncertainty was assessed.

data_collection_description: >
    Data from Ember Climate were accessed in August of 2024.

use_advice: >
    This process is intended to connect to electriciy generation processes from
    the electricity baseline.

## Admin information

project_description: >
    This dataset was developed by the Federal LCA Commons Data Curator Eastern
    Research Group, Inc. (ERG) under subcontract (SUB-2024-10066) to the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory under Department of Energy (DOE) Prime Contract
    No. DE-AC36-08GO28308. The work is funded by DOE's Advanced Materials &
    Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO).

intended_application: >
    This process is intended for use with electricity flows from the U.S.
    Electricity Baseline.
