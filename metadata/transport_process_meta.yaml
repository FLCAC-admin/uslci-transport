## General Information

description: >
    Average transport distances per transportation mode (i.e. truck, rail, water) 
    for commodities defined according to the Standard Classification of Transported 
    Goods (SCTG). Data sourced from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File. 
    These data represent U.S. average shipment characteristics per commodity.

time_description: >
    This process reflects a sample of four weeks of transportation activities, one 
    week per quarter, over the course of 2017. 

geography_description: >
    This process represents the average U.S. shipment for the commodity.

technology_description: >
    This data represents the standard transportation technology used in the U.S 
    for all modes excluding pipeline. The current default provider for pipeline 
    entries represent the transportation of crude petroleum which was selected as 
    a proxy for basic Basic Chemicals and non-metallic minerals, which included
    pipeline transportation modes.

## LCI method

inventory_method_description: >
    Not applicable; this process contains only technosphere flows. 
    This process contains the mixture of transport processes used to 
    model transport of a specific commodity moved within the U.S.

modeling_constants_description: >
    Approaches to compile and estimate average transport practices for U.S. commodities
    from Commodity Flow Survey data are described in the linked methodology document.
    Transportation technologies were mapped to those available in USLCI.

## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    This process contains no elementary flows. All transportation modes included in the 
    CFS data for each commodity are included. 

data_selection_description: >
    Data were retrieved for all available commodities.

data_treatment_description: >
    Estimation of the total mass of each commodity shipped per transportation mode was
    completed based on the 2017 CFS PUF User Guide instructions. Estimation of average 
    shipment distance for each commodity transport mode was completed based on the 
    2017 CFS PUF User Guide instructions. The shipment distances produced based on the 
    calculation from the 2017 CFS PUF User Guide are weighted based on the mass fraction 
    of the mass of commodity shipped by each mode. A more detailed discussion of the 
    methodology is included in the methodology document.

sampling_description: >
    The uncertainty included in the CFS PUF was not captured.

data_collection_description: >
    Data from the 2017 CFS PUF were accessed in Q4 of 2025. These data will remain
    unchanged. The CFS data are updated with each census but are released as separate
    data sets.

use_advice: >
    These data are intended to be used as proxies for commodity specifc transport inputs
    when primary or more relevant data are not available. It is recommended that the user
    review the transportation modes present in each process and make a judgement call 
    about which modes are relevant for the use case and which modes should be excluded.
