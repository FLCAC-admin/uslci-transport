## General Information

description: >
    Average transport distances per transportation mode (i.e. truck, rail, water) for commodities
    defined according to the Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG). Data sourced 
    from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File. These data represent U.S. average 
    shipment characteristics.

time_description: >
    This process reflects transportation activities over the course of 2017. 

geography_description: >
    This process represents the average U.S. shipment for the commodity.

technology_description: >
    This data represents the standard transportation technology used in the U.S 
    for all modes excluding pipeline. The current default provider for pipeline 
    entries represent the transportation of crude petroleum which was selected as 
    a proxy for basic Basic Chemicals and Non-metallic minerals.

## LCI method

inventory_method_description: >
    Not applicable; this process contains only technosphere flows. 
    This process contains the mixture of transport processes used to 
    model transport of a specific commodity moved within the U.S.

modeling_constants_description: >
    Approaches to compile and estimate average transport practices for U.S. commodities
    from Commodity Flow Survey data are described in the linked methodology document.
    Transportation technologies were mapped to those available in USLCI.

## Data Source information

completeness_description: >
    This process contains no elementary flows. All transportation modes included in the 
    CFS data for each commodity are included. 

data_selection_description: >
    Data were retrieved for all available commodities.

data_treatment_description: >
    Estimation of the total mass of each commodity shipped per transportation mode was
    completed based on the 2017 CFS PUF User Guide instructions. Estimation of average 
    shipment distance for each commodity transport mode was completed based on the 
    2017 CFS PUF User Guide instructions. The shipment distances produced based on the 
    calculation from the 2017 CFS PUF User Guide are weighted based on the mass fraction 
    of the mass of commodity shipped by each mode.

sampling_description: >
    The uncertainty included in the CFS PUF was not captured.

data_collection_description: >
    Data from the 2017 CFS PUF were accessed in Q4 of 2025. These data will remain
    unchanged. The CFS data are updated with each census but are released as separate
    data sets.

use_advice: >
    These data are inteded to be used as proxies for commodity specifc transport inputs
    when primary or more relevant data are not available. It is recommended that the user
    review the transportation modes present in each process and make a judgement call about
    which modes are relevant for the use case and which modes should be dropped.

project_description: >
    This dataset was developed by the Federal LCA Commons Data Curator Eastern
    Research Group, Inc. (ERG) under subcontract (SUB-2024-10066) to the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory under Department of Energy (DOE) Prime Contract
    No. DE-AC36-08GO28308. The work is funded by DOE's Advanced Materials &
    Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO).

intended_application: >
    This process is intended to provide representative mixes of transportation 
    for commodities in the US.
