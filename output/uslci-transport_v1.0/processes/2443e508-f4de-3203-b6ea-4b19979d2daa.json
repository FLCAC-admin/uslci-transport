Specific commodities that are included in each category can be found in the SCTG Commodity Code Manual which is referenced in the methodology document. The system boundaries for these processes are manufacturing or wholesale gate to consumer. Data are sourced from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File.
