Commodity categories are defined according to the Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG). The SCTG code for 'Mixed Freight' is '43'. Specific commodities that are included in each category can be found in the SCTG Commodity Code Manual which is referenced in the methodology document. The system boundaries for these processes are manufacturing or wholesale gate to consumer. Data are sourced from the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File. These data represent U.S. average shipment characteristics per commodity. These data are intended to model transportation of domestically transported and consumed goods. Shipment data for commodities that were ultimately exported from the United States were not included.\n",

The current default provider for pipeline entries represent the transportation of crude petroleum which was selected as a proxy for SCTG Code 20 (Basic Chemicals) and SCTG Code 31 (Non-Metallic Minerals). Currently, there are no pipeline processes in USLCI that specifically relate to chemical or mineral transport.\n",

It is recommended that the user review the transportation modes present in each process and make a judgement call about which modes are relevant for the use case and which modes should be excluded.
